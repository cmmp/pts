This is a projected topological stream clustering algorithm.

An example of a topological stream that this algorithm can be used with is [here](https://github.com/cmmp/subspacestream-generator). There is a conversion script to generate `.mat` files for easy opening in MATLAB.

Dependencies on [javaplex](https://github.com/appliedtopology/javaplex) are already included in this distribution.
